## Installation

Catto.JS requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to run. Minimal version of NodeJS depends on your use case - Catto.JS can work on very old versions as long as you disable some features.

CattoJS requires **v9.11.0+** to run, but other features like Discord bots may request you to use a newer version.

Install it in your project from [NPM Registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/catmagick) using a package manager: [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or [PNPM](https://pnpm.io).

```sh
# Install latest stable version from NPM Registry using NPM
npm install catto.js

# Install latest stable version from NPM Registry using Yarn
yarn add catto.js

# Install latest stable version from NPM Registry using PNPM
pnpm add catto.js
```

Or install the latest beta version in your project from [GitHub](https://github.com/BoryaGames/catto.js) using a package manager: [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or [PNPM](https://pnpm.io).

```sh
# Install latest beta version from GitHub using NPM
npm install git+https://github.com/BoryaGames/catto.js.git

### Getting started

```javascript
// Get started by importing catto.js
var cattojs = require("catto.js");
```

### Random

These functions are for generating random data.

```javascript
// Get a random floating point number between 1 and 5 inclusive
var num = cattojs.random.float(1, 5);

// Get a random number between 1 and 5 with starting number included (1, 2, 3, 4)
var num = cattojs.random.int(1, 5);

// Get a random number between 1 and 5 inclusive (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
var num = cattojs.random.range(1, 5);

// Get a random logic value (false, true)
var num = cattojs.random.bool();
```

### HTML

These functions are for working with HTML text.

```javascript
// This is now safe to show in the browser without getting XSS
var safe = cattojs.HTML.disable("<script>console.log('hacked');</script>");
```

### Utilities

These functions help you use JavaScript.

```javascript
var arr = ["a", "b", "c"];
if (arr.has("b")) { // shortcut for .includes()
  arr.remove(1); // remove element by index and return element
}
```

```javascript
// You can now use async replaces
var str = await something.replaceAsync("dog", async () => "cat");
```

```javascript
// Code will resume execution after bot.loaded will become true value
await cattojs.utils.waitFor(bot, "loaded");
```
